EPISODE,CDM,No,,No,0,,"The EPISODE table aggregates lower-level clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) into a higher-level abstraction representing clinically and analytically relevant disease phases/outcomes and treatments. The EPISODE_EVENT table connects qualifying clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) to the appropriate EPISODE entry.",,"Valid Episode Concepts belong to the 'Episode' domain.<br><br>
Standard Episode Concepts are categorized by concept class:<br>
Disease Episode<br>
 &emsp;32528 ""Disease First Occurrence""<br>
 &emsp;32529 ""Disease Recurrence""<br>
 &emsp;32530 ""Disease Remission""<br>
 &emsp;32677 ""Disease Progression""<br>
Treatment Episode
 &emsp;32531 ""Treatment Regimen""<br>
 &emsp;32532 ""Treatment Cycle""<br>
Episode of Care
 &emsp;32533 ""Episode of Care""<br><br>
The relationship between a disease episode and treatment episodes can be represented by the self-referencing foreign key column EPISODE.episode_parent_id.<br><br>
A treatment EPISODE can be delivered at regular intervals, cycles or fractions. The parent-child relationship between a treatment episode and its constituent treatment cycles can be represented by the self-referencing foreign key column EPISODE.episode_parent_id.

EPISODE_EVENT,CDM,No,,No,0,,"The EPISODE_EVENT table connects qualifying clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) to the appropriate EPISODE entry.

MEASUREMENT,CDM,No,MEASUREMENT_,Yes,0,,"The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurement, i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or Person's sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit (UNIT_CONCEPT_ID).",Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result. ,
CONCEPT_NUMERIC,VOCAB,No,,No,0,,"In this table, numeric values, units and math operators indicating range limits (less than) corresponding to ""numeric"" concepts will be stored. It is an extension of the OMOP CDM and vocabulary that supports formal representation of concepts containing numeric values or ranges. This proposal has not yet been ratified by a larger CDM Workgroup. However, it plays a critical role in supporting ETL from tumor registries. NAACCR vocabulary includes concepts representing numeric values or numeric ranges. Often, these concepts also contain measurement units. For example, ""Described as less than 1 centimeter (cm)"". In OMOP CDM, these concepts are normally used in Measurement and Observation tables to store value_as_concept_id. Analysis of these data is currently possible only if the user knows exactly which concepts are used to represent range or value, including their respective units. It is not possible to perform analysis on numeric values of these data, nor is it possible to differentiate numeric values by units. ",,
