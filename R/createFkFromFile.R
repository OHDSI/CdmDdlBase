#' Create a foreign key sql script from two csv files that detail the OMOP CDM Specifications.

#' @param cdmVersionNum The version of the CDM you are creating
#'
#' @param cdmFieldCsvLoc The location of the csv file with the CDM field information. This is defaulted to "inst/csv/OMOP_CDMv5.3.1_Field_Level.csv".
#'                        If a new version of this file was committed to the CDM repository the package automatically will grab it and place it in "inst/csv/".
#' @param outputFile  The name of the output foreign key file. This is defaulted to a location in the inst/sql/sql server folder and named with today's date and CDM version.
#' @export
